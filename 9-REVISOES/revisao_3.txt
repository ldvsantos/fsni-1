Reviewer #1: This study employed field experimental methods, combining three tillage systems—conventional tillage (CT), minimum tillage (MT), and no-tillage (NT)—with four preceding cover crops—sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan (L.) Millsp.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), and pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum (L.) Leeke)—to evaluate the relationship between soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil structure, as well as their impact on corn yield in long-term experimental plots in northeastern Brazil. The results indicated that preceding cover crops enhanced SOC content, with cowpea preceding MT providing better soil structuring, while pigeon pea resulted in the highest corn yield. After 22 years, the CT system improved the soil structure of the study area, increasing soil aggregation and corn yield. However, there are still some aspects of the article that need to be revised to enhance the depth of the paper. Here are other comments:
1、Materials and methods: Although this study is based on a long-term experiment established for 22 years, soil sampling and analysis were conducted only in the 2022 cropping season. This single-year sampling approach may introduce bias due to inter-annual climatic variability and its influence on biological processes and crop performance. It is strongly recommended to explicitly acknowledge this limitation in the discussion. Furthermore, the necessity of continued monitoring in subsequent years to verify the stability and representativeness of the reported results should be discussed.
2、Materials and methods: This study selected four specific cover crops (sum hemp, pigeon pea, cowpea, pearl millet), but the rationale behind choosing these particular species over others is not sufficiently justified (Line 14). Please provide the selection criteria, elaborating on their representativeness in local agricultural systems and their anticipated specific impacts on soil properties (e.g., N fixation for legumes, C:N ratio for millet) and subsequent crop yield. This will significantly strengthen the rationale behind the experimental design.
3、2.3: This study is restricted to the 0-20 cm soil layer (0-10 cm and 10-20 cm). This depth may not fully capture the differential impacts of the tillage systems on the soil profile. The effects of no-tillage (NT) are often most pronounced in the surface layer (0-10 cm), whereas conventional tillage (CT) disturbs the entire plough layer. Critically, long-term NT may lead to subsoil compaction or the formation of a plough pan below 20 cm. Furthermore, as a deep-rooted species, pigeon pea likely influences aggregate stability and organic carbon dynamics in deeper layers. It is recommended to include analysis of a deeper soil layer (e.g., 20-40 cm) for a more comprehensive assessment of management impacts on soil structure.
4、Abstract: The abstract mentions a "3×4×2 factorial scheme." However, the Materials and methods section describes only three tillage systems and four cover crops. The nature of the third factor (represented by "×2") is not explained. Please clarify this discrepancy and explicitly define all factors involved in the experimental design.
5、Results and discussion: The discussion lacks mechanistic depth. For instance, the finding that minimum tillage (MT) resulted in higher SOC content compared to no-tillage (NT) is noteworthy but insufficiently explained. The discussion should delve into the potential mechanisms behind this observation, considering the tropical edaphoclimatic conditions (e.g., high temperatures and rainfall). Possible explanations could include the balance between soil disturbance (aiding incorporation in MT vs. surface accumulation in NT), residue decomposition rates, and priming effects under different management practices.
6、3.2: There is a direct contradiction between the abstract, which states that "CT systems improved structural conditions," and the results presented in Section 3.2 and Table 4, which clearly show that CT yielded the lowest values for mean geometric diameter (MGD) and mean weight diameter (MWD) - key indicators of aggregate stability. The statement in the abstract must be revised to accurately reflect the experimental findings, which demonstrate the superior structural benefits associated with conservation systems (NT and MT), particularly when combined with specific cover crops like pigeon pea.
7、2.2.2: The methodology for aggregate stability analysis lacks critical details regarding the sample size (mass/volume), sampling tools (e.g., type of auger), and sample storage conditions prior to analysis. These omissions hinder the reproducibility of the experiment. Please provide a precise description of the sampling protocol to ensure methodological rigor.


Reviewer #2: This manuscript focuses on the dystrophic Red-Yellow Argisol (Ultisol in the international soil classification system) in the coastal plateau of northeastern Brazil, a critical region for ecological and agricultural production. Centered on the long-term interactive effects of "tillage practices - cover crops - soil carbon pool - aggregate structure - maize yield," the research topic demonstrates both scientific innovation and practical application value. The high temperature and abundant rainfall in tropical regions accelerate soil organic matter decomposition and structural degradation, while the inherent deficiencies of Ultisol, such as nutrient poverty, high clay content, and poor structure, severely constrain agricultural sustainability. Based on a 22-year long-term field experiment (2001-2023), the study employed an interactive design of three tillage practices (conventional tillage CT, minimum tillage MT, no-till NT) and four cover crops (cowpea, pigeon
pea, sunflower, and millet), combined with wet sieving, multivariate statistical analysis (ANOVA, PCA), and linear regression methods. It systematically revealed, for the first time, the synergistic enhancement mechanism of "minimum tillage (MT) + leguminous cover crops (pigeon pea, cowpea)" on organic carbon sequestration, aggregate stability, and commercial ear yield of maize in tropical Ultisol, filling the research gap in "tillage-cover crop combinations' coupling regulation of soil carbon-structure in long-term tropical agricultural systems." The research outcomes not only provide operational solutions for maintaining soil health in maize cultivation areas of Brazil's coastal plateau but also revise the traditional notion that "no-till (NT) is inherently superior to other tillage practices in tropical regions," offering a new paradigm for sustainable management of low-fertility tropical soils worldwide, with precise academic positioning and clear application prospects.
1. The abstract concurrently mentions "the improvement of old soil structure, enhancement of aggregate formation, and increase in commercial spike yield through CT system after 22 years" and "the enhancement of aggregate stability through no-tillage (NT)," without clearly delineating their respective application scenarios and distinctions, resulting in logical conflicts in key conclusions. Furthermore, it fails to quantify the specific effects of different tillage-cover crop combinations, rendering the results ambiguous.
2.Methodological deficiencies are evident: the soil sampling depth is not specified (only "long-term experiment" is mentioned without clear delineation of 0-10cm/10-20cm stratified design), operational parameters for wet sieving in aggregate determination are omitted, and the calculation basis for carbon stock (CS) is not provided (e.g., soil bulk density measurement method). The methodological transparency is insufficient.
3.The academic value remains inadequately highlighted: the study merely provides a generic statement that it "offers references for tropical soil conservation," without conducting comparative analyses with existing research (such as the differences in cultivation effects between temperate and tropical regions). Furthermore, it fails to elucidate how this research contributes to the theoretical framework of "carbon-structure synergy enhancement in tropical Oxisols," resulting in unclear innovative contributions.
4.The study area lacks comprehensive soil baseline data: only the soil type is identified as "dystrophic Red-Yellow Argisol (Ultisol)," without specifying soil texture (e.g., sand/silt/clay content) or initial soil physicochemical properties (e.g., SOC, pH, bulk density) in the baseline year (2001). Given that texture is a critical factor influencing aggregate formation, the absence of initial data compromises the establishment of a benchmark for long-term effect analysis.
5.The data table format is disorganized: In Table 1 "SOC and CS under Different Tillage and Cover Crops," the SOC data for "CT - Control," "MT - Control," and "NT - Control" are not clearly delineated by rows, and the "significance letter markings" do not correspond to specific P-values. Additionally, in Tables 2-6, the "β coefficients" contain numerical formatting errors, significantly impairing data readability.
6.Insufficient climatic data granularity: The description merely states "annual precipitation of 1600mm with distinct wet and dry seasons (wet season from April to September)" without specifying monthly precipitation averages during the wet season or extreme drought days in the dry season. In tropical regions, precipitation distribution directly influences cover crop biomass and soil moisture conditions, and the lack of detailed climatic information may lead to biased interpretation of results.
7.The experimental design lacks critical details: the specific plot size and replication settings were not specified (only "three replications" were mentioned without clear plot dimensions), and the sowing density of cover crops, cutting time, and incorporation methods (e.g., whether plowed under) were not described. Since the biomass input of cover crops directly affects SOC accumulation, the absence of operational details significantly compromises the reproducibility of the results.
8.The protocol for aggregate analysis is incomplete: it merely mentions "utilizing the Yoder apparatus wet-sieving method" without specifying the pretreatment of soil samples (such as the sieve specifications for air-dried soil), oscillation duration and frequency. Furthermore, it fails to clarify the source of the calculation formulas for "Mean Geometric Diameter (MGD)" and "Mean Weight Diameter (MWD)", indicating insufficient methodological standardization.
9.The data analysis exhibits logical inconsistencies: the rationale for variable selection in Principal Component Analysis (PCA) remains unaddressed (e.g., why only eight variables including SOC and MGD were included, while soil bulk density and porosity were excluded); furthermore, the screening criteria for the "forward stepwise method" in multiple linear regression (e.g., the F-value threshold) were not specified, resulting in insufficient justification for the model's validity.
10.The interpretation of the charts lacks depth: Table 1, "SOC and CS under Different Treatments," merely enumerates data without analyzing the reasons why "MT + Millet" significantly outperforms other combinations (e.g., high millet biomass, suitable C/N ratio). Figure 2, "Number of Productive Spikes," fails to annotate the specific numerical differences among various treatments, resulting in a disconnection between the outcomes and the underlying mechanisms.
11.The statistical significance notation is inadequately standardized: multiple tables (e.g., Table 2, Table 3) exhibit numerical errors in the "Sig. (Significance)" column (such as the repeated notation of "0.70"), and fail to maintain consistent alphabetical marking conventions across charts (e.g., some tables use "Aa/Bb" while others lack annotations), resulting in insufficient visual support for data significance.
12.The logical hierarchy of the results is disorganized: Section 3.2 "Aggregate Stability" simultaneously presents the effects of NT, MT, and CT without following the hierarchical structure of "tillage method → cover crop → interaction effect." Furthermore, it fails to compare the differential mechanisms between distinct soil layers (0-10cm vs. 10-20cm), and the critical trends are not adequately emphasized.
13.The study exhibits insufficient engagement with existing literature: it merely cites "Chen et al., 2020" in a general manner regarding the enhancement of aggregate stability through no-tillage practices, without contrasting the underlying reasons for the observed superiority of MT over NT in this research (e.g., long-term subsoil compaction caused by NT in tropical regions). Furthermore, it fails to reference comparable local studies from Brazil, and the regional specificity of the research remains unclarified.
14.The mechanism analysis remains incomplete: while the proposition that "leguminous cover crops promote SOC accumulation through nitrogen fixation" is presented, the differential mechanisms between distinct leguminous species (e.g., pigeon pea vs. cowpea) are not elucidated. Furthermore, the rationale for "MT's ability to balance carbon sequestration with yield" is not adequately explained, resulting in a discontinuity within the mechanistic chain.
15.The research limitations were not addressed: the discussion omitted the representativeness of the 22-year trial period (e.g., whether it included extreme climate years), the impact of unquantified cover crop biomass on the results, and the potential restriction of generalizability due to the specificity of the corn variety (SHS7990 PRO3). Consequently, the objectivity and universality of the study are insufficient.
16.The conclusion exhibits a disconnect from the findings: it merely summarizes that "MT + cover crops enhance SOC and yield," failing to address the key findings from the preceding discussion, namely that "MT + millet achieves the highest carbon storage" and "MT + pigeon pea yields the highest production." Furthermore, it omits the mention of "NT's advantage in aggregate stability despite its yield disadvantage," resulting in a conclusion that lacks specificity and relevance.
17.The practical guidance lacks specificity: it fails to clearly delineate the "optimal management strategies under different objectives" (e.g., selecting MT + millet for carbon sequestration or MT + pigeon pea for yield maximization), merely mentioning "providing a scientific basis," thus limiting its practical applicability. The logical structure is disjointed: the conclusions are presented as isolated points without a progressive relationship, with key elements such as "SOC differences," "CS accumulation," "aggregate stability," and "yield" merely listed without establishing a coherent "management measures → soil processes → production effects" logical framework.
18.Insufficient regional representation in the literature: Only three local studies from Brazil were cited, predominantly from pre-2012, with a notable absence of recent research on tropical soil management in Brazil post-2020, indicating inadequate regional specificity.
19.Inconsistent use of technical terminology: multiple instances of contradictory terms observed throughout the text.
20.Grammatical errors and sentence confusion: There are incomplete sentence components (such as "Preceding cover crops improved soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, with cowpea preceding MT providing better soil structuring"）, logical connectives are incorrect (such as"However, CT presented the lowest MGD values… At 10-20 cm depth, this system showed the lowest MGD"）。
21.There are many redundant expressions."the relationship between soil organic carbon and soil structure" The repetition of information across the abstract, introduction, and conclusion sections, as well as the redundant presentation of SOC specific values in both the main text and tables (e.g., 1.41 g·kg⁻¹ mentioned in both Table 1 and the main text), results in a lack of conciseness in the language.
