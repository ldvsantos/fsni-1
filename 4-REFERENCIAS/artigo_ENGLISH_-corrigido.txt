Abstract
The conversion of natural ecosystems into agricultural systems alters the dynamics of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) in the soil, impacting the sustainability of tropical environments. This study introduces the Fuzzy Soil Nutritional Sustainability Index (FSNSI), a robust methodological tool designed to evaluate the functional dynamics of N and P in labile and humic fractions under different land uses (e.g., native vegetation, silviculture, and agriculture). This study aimed to evaluate the functional dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in the humic and labile fractions of the soil under different land uses, proposing and validating an integrated analytical framework (PLSR, PLS-SEM, and FSNSI) for the diagnosis of soil nutritional sustainability. This framework advances the understanding of the co-stabilization mechanisms of N and P in tropical soils, offering scientific support for LCSA and sustainable land management strategies. Data analysis confirmed the humic fractions as dominant predictors (VIP > 1.0) of nutrient availability, with humic fractions exerting a strong positive effect on total N and P stocks (β = 1.286). The symmetry of the coefficients between N and P suggests a fundamental biogeochemical coupling in highly weathered soils. The FSNSI successfully differentiated the land uses, with silvicultural systems showing the highest functionality, while soil density was confirmed as a transversal limiting factor. It is concluded that the enrichment of humic fractions, associated with better litter input and physical structure, is the main support for N and P stocks and soil functionality. The proposed methodological integration (PLSR, PLS-SEM, and FSNSI) constitutes a robust and multiscale approach for diagnosing soil nutritional sustainability, informing sustainable production policies, and guiding conservation interventions in tropical environments.

1. Introduction
Tropical soils constitute complex and dynamic biogeochemical systems, in which soil organic matter (SOM) plays a fundamental role in regulating nutrient cycles, structural aggregation, and maintaining fertility (Lavallee et al., 2020; Lal et a., 2020). The conversion of native ecosystems into agricultural and silvicultural areas alters the input and quality of organic residues, accelerating decomposition and reducing the formation of stable humic compounds. This transformation decreases nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) stocks, compromising nutrient cycling and soil resilience (Silva et al., 2024; Tivet et al., 2013).
In the Cerrado biome, a global biodiversity hotspot, such impacts are critical. Its soils, highly weathered, acidic, and naturally poor in nutrients, depend on the stability of the humic fractions of SOM to maintain their ecological and productive functions (Locatelli et al., 2023). Humic substances, humic acids (HA), fulvic acids (FA), and humin (Hum) act as nutrient reservoirs, regulating water retention and the formation of stable aggregates Lehmann et al., 2015; Paul et al., 2016). Through adsorption, complexation, and biogenic immobilization, these fractions stabilize N and P, reducing losses and promoting the persistence of nutrients in the system (Stevenson, 1994; Gerke, 2022).
In recent years, there has been growing scientific interest in understanding the biogeochemical coupling between N and P and how they co-stabilize in SOM. Evidence indicates that they are co-regulated by interdependent processes of decomposition, humification, and organo-mineral protection. Mechanisms such as incorporation into microbial biomass, competition for adsorption sites, the formation of complexes with humic substances, and physical co-occlusion in microaggregates stabilize N and P, protecting them from rapid mineralization and ensuring their persistence in the system (Cao et al., 2021; Gerke, 2022).
These interactions demonstrate that disturbances in the cycle of one nutrient generate stoichiometric imbalances that affect the efficiency of use of the other, compromising the stability of soil organic matter and soil sustainability (Marinho Junior et al., 2021). However, most studies still treat N and P separately, ignoring their structural and functional interrelationships.
Notwithstanding significant strides in the modeling of edaphic processes, a critical methodological hiatus remains regarding the development of soil sustainability indicators that are simultaneously robust, capable of handling data non-linearity and uncertainty, and integratable into broader sustainability assessment frameworks (Leeuwen et al., 2020). Traditional soil fertility or quality indicators are often reductionist, unidimensional, or abstruse to stakeholders outside the soil science domain (Vereecken et al., 2018). For land management to effectively inform Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) and supply chain management decisions, which are pivotal for sustainable production and consumption, it is imperative to develop metrics that translate soil complexity into an aggregated and scalable index (Toth et al., 2018).
Recent advances in modeling have enabled the integration of multiple edaphic attributes to investigate these relationships. Structural equation modeling based on partial least squares (PLS-SEM) allows the identification of causal relationships among soil compartments and biogeochemical processes, quantifying the direct and indirect effects of variables such as bulk density and humic fractions on nutrient stocks (Hair et al., 2021). This technique is particularly useful in tropical systems, where multiple factors interact simultaneously.
Additionally, computational intelligence methods, such as fuzzy inference systems, allow the integration of chemical and physical variables into a single index of soil functionality, reflecting the continuous and non-linear nature of edaphic responses to different management practices (Mamdani, 1977; Reis et al., 2023). The combination of PLS-SEM and fuzzy inference provides a comprehensive approach to diagnosing soil sustainability. This integration enables the formulation of composite indicators, such as the Fuzzy Edaphic Sustainability Index (FESI) or the Soil Nutritional Functionality Index (FSNSI), which synthesizes the biogeochemical functionality of systems under different land uses (Reis et al., 2023).
Agricultural intensification and conventional soil preparation reduce particulate organic matter and break down organo-mineral complexes, increasing bulk density and decreasing porosity (Iversen et al., 2022). These physical effects restrict gas diffusion, water infiltration, and microbial activity, compromising the cycling and co-stabilization of N and P (Vereecken et al., 2018). Thus, physical degradation, expressed by the increase in bulk density, is a limiting factor of soil functionality, interacting with biogeochemical processes and directly affecting soil sustainability (Khalaf et al., 2020; Mendes et al., 2019).
Based on this context, it is hypothesized that the humic and labile fractions of N and P contribute distinctly and complementarily to the total stocks of these nutrients, and that physical degradation acts as a mediating variable of soil functionality (Condron  et al., 2011; Jensen et al., 2020). It is expected that soils under native vegetation will present a higher proportion of N and P in humic fractions and greater biogeochemical co-stabilization, while agricultural and silvicultural systems will reveal a predominance of labile forms and less synergy between the N and P cycles (Macci et al., 2016).
Within this framework, the Soil Nutritional Functionality Index (FSNSI) emerges as a pivotal solution (Leeuwen et al., 2023). By synthesizing N and P dynamics with physical degradation metrics, the FSNSI operates twofold: it not only diagnoses local sustainability but also provides an aggregated quantitative impact indicator for the production phase within a Life Cycle Thinking (LCT) perspective (Sala et al., 2019; Powlson et al., 2012). Consequently, soil functionality, thus quantified, becomes a critical input for LCSA, empowering corporate stakeholders and policymakers to more accurately assess the ecological footprint of their products and the impact of differential land uses on global sustainability.
This study aimed to evaluate the functional dynamics of nitrogen and phosphorus in the humic and labile fractions of the soil under different land uses, proposing and validating an integrated analytical framework (PLSR, PLS-SEM, and FSNSI) for the diagnosis of soil nutritional sustainability. This framework advances the understanding of the co-stabilization mechanisms of N and P in tropical soils, offering scientific support for LCSA and sustainable land management strategies.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Study area
The research was conducted in the municipality of São Valério in Tocantins, with a total area of 53.23 ha, at the geographical coordinates 11º54’37” S and 48º12’31” W (Figure 1).
Figure 1 – Location of the experimental areas.
 
The area has an altitude of around 360 m in the municipal seat, with the region's climate being of the seasonal tropical type, classified as Aw according to Köppen (Thornthwaite, 1948), characterized by two well-defined seasons, with a rainy summer between October and April and a dry winter from May to September. The average annual variation is around 1,480 mm and the average monthly temperatures vary slightly throughout the year, with average daily values around 27 °C, minimums of 21–24 °C and maximums between 30 and 35 °C (Santos et al., 2025).
The relief is predominantly gently undulating, inserted in the typical landscape of the Cerrado biome, and the soils are, for the most part, well-drained Red-Yelloe Oxisoils with low natural fertility (Santos et al., 2025).
2.2 Characteristics of the study areas
The preserved Cerrado (sensu stricto) area (Figure 2a), considered as a control area, covers 44.82 ha and is over 40 years old, located at coordinates 11°54’57’’S and 48°11’59’’W (Figure 2). The vegetation exhibits a typical physiognomy of dense Cerrado, with trees ranging from 5 to 8 meters in height, since the Cerrado in its restricted sense comprises exclusively savanna formations. Despite this, within the savanna domain, there is considerable structural variation in the vegetation, with physiognomies ranging from sparse to dense Cerrado (Lacerda et al., 2025).
Figure 2 — Studied areas. Photomontage of the areas: (a) Cerrado sensu stricto (preserved native vegetation); (b) eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.); (c) african mahogany (Khaya ivorensis); (d) teak (Tectona grandis); (e) agriculture (soybean/corn in rotation).
 
A vegetation survey was conducted to calculate phytosociological parameters: Relative Density (RD), Relative Dominance (RDM), Relative Frequency (RF), and Importance Value Index (IVI) (Queiroz et al., 2017) (Appendix 1).
The eucalyptus (Eucalyptus sp.) plantation covers a total area of 2.29 hectares and is five years old, located at coordinates 11°54’32’’S, 48°12’22’’W (Figure 2b). The planting density was approximately 1667 seedlings/ha with a spacing of 3 x 2 m, in holes measuring 0.40 x 0.40 x 0.40 m, dug manually with shovels, followed by the application of NPK fertilizer, in the 5-25-15 formulation, in order to stimulate plant development and better adaptation of the seedlings to the soil (Vera et al., 2022).
At the beginning of planting, base fertilization was carried out with 20 kg of Ca2+, 0.8 kg of Zn2+, 12 kg of S (SO42-), 1.6 kg of Cu2+, and 1.6 kg of B (H3BO3). Area clearing, to remove native vegetation, was performed using a front blade attached to a crawler tractor, followed by plowing and harrowing, allowing for greater oxygen interaction with the soil, which enables improvements in chemical and biological processes (Boudiar et al., 2022). Regarding the process of aligning and squaring the seedlings, the Right Triangle method (3/4/5) was used with the aid of stakes and a measuring tape (Vera et al., 2022).
The african mahogany (K. ivorensis) plantation covers a total area of 1.94 ha, is seven years old, and is located at coordinates 11°54’29’’S, 48°12’10’’W (Figure 2c). Planting was carried out in pits measuring 0.40 x 0.40 x 0.40 m, with spacings of 3 x 3 m and a density of 1111 seedlings/ha. During planting, 0.2 kg of NPK fertilizer with a 00-10-10 formulation and 5 kg of cured bovine manure were added to each pit. These were applied every three months during the first year of growth.  Thinning was also carried out when the canopies began to touch, resulting in a final spacing of 6 x 6 meters (Lucena et al., 2024). Similar to the eucalyptus area, the clearing of the area was carried out with the help of a front blade attached to a crawler tractor, followed by plowing and harrowing services (Lima et al., 2023).
The teak (T. grandis) plantation covers a total area of 1.12 ha, and is ten years old, located at coordinates 11°54’22’’S and 48°12’17’’W (Figure 2d). Area preparation before planting was carried out using a front blade attached to a crawler tractor, followed by plowing and harrowing (Lima et al., 2023). During the first year, two top dressings were applied, the first at 60 days and the other in the eighth month, with the application of 95 g per planting hole of NPK with a 20-05-20 formulation (Vieira et al., 2017).
Planting was done manually at a spacing of 3 x 2 m, in dimensions of 0.40 x 0.40 m, with 1,667 seedlings/hectare, which were individually planted with their collars at ground level. Replanting of failed seedlings was also carried out, as well as weeding in the first year, since teak is particularly sensitive to competition from grasses, thus requiring the land to be kept well weeded; in the second year, the shading provided by the teak prevented much of the weed development, reducing the need for weeding and mowing, and in the third year, no further cultural treatments were necessary (Moreira et al., 2021). In addition, pruning and debudding activities were carried out with the help of saws, with constant observations regarding the size of the branches.
Finally, the agricultural area covers 3.06 ha, is more than 10 years old, and is located at coordinates 11°54’44’’S and 48°12’02’’W (Figure 2e). The area dedicated to agriculture has been in use for more than 10 years, with crop rotation between corn and soybeans. At the time of collection, the area was being used for soybean cultivation, which extends between the months of June and September. Activities included harrowing and leveling the soil, followed by the application of 300 kg ha-1 of NPK in the 4-28-10 formulation, with a spacing of 0.5 m between plants. The plants were treated throughout the planting period with thiophanate-methyl and azoxystrobin fungicides, and insecticides, at a dosage of 100 g per 50 kg of seeds, in addition to weed removal (Machado et al., 2024).
Corn cultivation, on the other hand, extends from January to March, due to the favorable conditions promoted by rainfall. Soil preparation was carried out through harrowing and furrowing, with an average spacing between plants of 0.2 x 0.8 m and fertilization with 400 kg of 4-14-18 per ha-1, inside the sowing furrow, and 50, 100 and 150 kg of N per ha-1, on the soil surface, combined with procedures related to weed control, through manual weeding and the use of herbicides when necessary (Camargo et al., 2024).
2.3 Soil sampling
Five trenches in each studied area, with dimensions of 70 × 70 × 100 cm (Figure 3) at different points (Marinho Junior et al., 2021), were opened manually, totaling twenty-five trenches.
Figure 3 – Soil collection in an area of native vegetation (Cerrado sensu stricto).
 
Soil samples, both disturbed and undisturbed, were collected for physical and chemical analyses at depths of 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm. The disturbed soil samples were then air-dried and sieved through a 2 mm sieve for subsequent analyses.
2.4 Physical soil analyses
The determination of the soil particle size distribution was performed on disturbed samples, using the pipette method, as described by (Teixeira et al., 2017) (Table 2), and the soil density was obtained by the volumetric cylinder method (Teixeira et al., 2017) (Appendix 2).
2.5 Chemical soil analyses
2.5.1 Determination of total nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil
Soil samples were initially air-dried, sieved through a 2 mm mesh, and homogenized. A subsample was then ground in a porcelain mortar and pestle until a fine and uniform powder was obtained, and then passed again through a 150 μm (100 mesh) sieve. Total nitrogen (totalN) content was determined by the dry combustion method, using an elemental analyzer (Model PE-2400 Series II, Perkin Elmer).
For the determination of total phosphorus (totalP), the samples sieved through a 150 μm mesh were subjected to wet digestion. The totalP content was determined by colorimetry (Murphy & Riley, 1962).
2.5.2 Fractionation of humic substances and separation of light organic matter  
Humic substances were extracted from soil samples using the fractionation procedure recommended by the International Humic Substances Society (IHSS) (Swift, 1996). The method is based on the differences in solubility of the organic fractions in alkaline and acidic solutions, allowing the separation of fulvic acid (FA), humic acid (HA), and humin (Hum) fractions. Light organic matter (LOM) was separated by flotation in water (Fraga & Salcedo, 2004).
2.5.3 Determination of nitrogen and phosphorus in humic fractions and light organic matter 
After fractionation of the humic substances, the samples were frozen and lyophilized for the determination of N and P content in the FA, HA, and Hum fractions. P was quantified by the colorimetric method of (Murphy & Riley, 1962). N content in the same humic fractions was determined by dry combustion using an elemental analyzer (Model PE-2400 Series II, Perkin Elmer). Phosphorus associated with light organic matter (P-LOM) was determined by the colorimetric method (Murphy & Riley, 1962), while nitrogen (N-LOM) was quantified by dry combustion using the CHNS/O analyzer (Perkin Elmer PE-2400).
The labile fractions of phosphorus and nitrogen (labile P and labile N) were determined according to established methodologies. Labile P was obtained by the extraction procedure (Hedley et al., 1982), followed by colorimetric quantification according to the method (Murphy & Riley, 1962). Labile N, in turn, was determined indirectly by the method of (Shang & Tiessen, 1997), which is based on the selective oxidation of the labile fraction with KMnO₄ and subsequent colorimetric reading.
2.5.4 Determination of nitrogen and phosphorus stocks
N and P stocks were calculated from the concentrations obtained in the soil and in the respective humic fractions, considering the soil density and the thickness of the sampled layers. For each depth, the stock (Est) of each element was determined according to Equations 1 and 2:
Est(N)= TN*Ds*e	(1)

Est(N)= TN*Ds*e	(2)
Est(P) and Est(N): phosphorus and nitrogen stocks in the soil layer (Mg ha⁻¹); TP and TN: P and N contents in the analyzed fraction (g kg⁻¹); Ds: soil density (g cm⁻³); and e: thickness of the sampled layer (cm). The TN and TP stock was determined by summing the values of the layers from 0 to 1.0 m.
2.6 Statistical analyses
2.6.1 Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
The relationship between the N and P fractions and their total stocks was evaluated using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), a multivariate method suitable for datasets with high collinearity between variables. Two independent models were fitted: one for TN and another for TP, considering the labile and humic fractions and their respective estimated stocks as predictors. Both models used two latent components (LV1 and LV2) and leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation to assess predictive performance.
The analyses were performed using the pls package (Mevik & Wehrens, 2007). The explained variance (R²X and R²Y) and correlation biplots were used to visualize the covariance structure between the variables, while the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores allowed the identification of the main predictors of the total stocks. Variables with VIP > 1.0 were considered relevant for the models.
2.6.2 Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM)
The biogeochemical functioning of the soil, focusing on the dynamics of N and P and the integration of their labile and humic fractions into total stocks, was evaluated using a dual approach. Structural Equation Modeling with Partial Least Squares (PLS-SEM) elucidated the causal relationships between latent constructs and total nutrient stocks, offering a structural view of soil dynamics.
In parallel, the Fuzzy Nutritional Sustainability Index (FSNSI) was developed, based on a Mamdani system, to synthesize the functional performance of the soil into a single indicator.
The input variables were the total stocks of N and P and Ds, the latter treated as a penalizing factor with inverted normalization on a [0–10] scale, so that higher values represented unfavorable physical conditions. The system was configured with conservative normalization, triangular membership functions, specialized linguistic rules, and defuzzification using the centroid method. Granulometric fractions (sand, silt, and clay) were included as control covariates, allowing the isolation of the effect of soil use and management and minimizing the bias associated with textural differences between environments.
2.6.3 Normalization of variables
To ensure comparability between variables of different scales and orders of magnitude, the data were normalized on a common scale from 0 to 10. To standardize the variables on a common scale between 0 and 10, two conservative linear normalization models were adopted (Equation 3).

x_"norm" =10×(x-x_min)/(x_max-x_min ), "with " x∈[x_min,x_max]	(3)

Where: x is the original value of the variable; x_min is the lowest observed value of variable x; x_max is the highest observed value of variable x; and x_"norm"  is the normalized value on a scale of 0 to 10.
For variables with inverse interpretation (such as Ds, whose increase is associated with lower structural quality), an inverted normalization was applied (Equation 4), assigning higher scores to lower values:
x_"norm" =10×(x_max-x)/(x_max-x_min ), "with " x∈[x_min,x_max]	(4)

In this sense, when x=x_min, then x_"norm" =10 → best value; and when x=x_max, then x_"norm" =0 → worst value. In both cases, non-finite or constant values were assigned neutral imputations (score = 5), ensuring numerical robustness.

2.6.4 Fuzzy system structure and inference rules

The fuzzy inference system was implemented in the R environment using the FuzzyR package, adopting the Mamdani type logic for the construction of the Fuzzy Nutritional Support Index (FSNSI). Three input variables were used: normalized TN, normalized TP, and normalized and inverted Ds.
The output variable FSNSI was modeled with three qualitative linguistic terms: low, medium, and high, all defined in the continuous interval from 0 to 10. The membership functions follow the general form of symmetrical or asymmetrical triangles, as per Equation 5 for the Low term, Equation 6 for the Medium term, and Equation 7 for the High term.
μ_"low"  (x)=max(min((x-a)/(b-a),(c-x)/(c-b)),0), "with "(a,b,c)=(0,0,4)	(5)

μ_"medium"  (x)=max(min((x-a)/(b-a),(c-x)/(c-b)),0), "with "(a,b,c)=(3,5,7)	(6)

μ_"high"  (x)=max(min((x-a)/(b-a),(c-x)/(c-b)),0), "with "(a,b,c)=(6,10,10)	(7)

The domain of the triangular function was adjusted to ensure overlap between the terms, allowing for continuous and smoothed inferences.

2.6.5 Fuzzy rule base
The knowledge base was composed of seven linguistic "IF-THEN" rules, based on the combination of the linguistic terms of the input variables. The structure of the rules follows the generic form (Equation 8):
R_((i)):"SE " x_1∈A_1∧x_2∈A_2∧x_3∈A_3⇒y∈B_i	(8)
The activation of each rule R_((i)) was calculated according to Equation 9:
α_i=min(μ_A1 (x_1),μ_A2 (x_2),…,μ_An (x_n))	(9)
The corresponding output value μ_(B_i ) (z) was weighted by α_i and the activated sets were aggregated via the MAX operator. To incorporate the role of Ds as a functional penalty, the weights wi assigned to each rule were dynamically adjusted as a function of the linguistic classification of Ds.
Rules with high density (linguistic category "low" on the inverted scale) received reduced weights (between 0.4 and 0.6), while rules with low density (category "high") were assigned higher weights (up to 1.5). This adjustment aims to reinforce the influence of the physical quality of the soil in determining functionality.
2.6.6 Defuzzification of the functional index
The final value of the FSNSI index was obtained through the centroid defuzzification process, according to Equation 10:
"FSNSI"=(∫_0^10▒μ_"FSNSI"  (z)⋅z dz)/(∫_0^10▒μ_"FSNSI"  (z) dz)	(10)

Where μFSNSI(z) represents the aggregated membership function resulting from the combination of all activated rules for a given set of inputs, and (z) is the continuous domain of the output variable. The resulting crisp value of the FSNSI index assumes continuous values between 0 and 10 and was interpreted according to three qualitative ranges: (0.0 to 3.3) low functionality; (3.4 to 6.6) intermediate functionality; and (6.7 to 10.0) high functionality.

3. Results and Discussion
3.1 Prediction of total nitrogen

The PLSR analysis for TN was performed using the N fractions as predictor variables, allowing the identification of the relative contributions of each functional compartment. The results are presented in (Figure 4), which shows the biplot with the sample scores by land use and the loadings of the predictor variables, highlighting the covariance structure between the fractions and the total stocks. These results are consistent with the functional interpretation in which the humic fractions, due to their higher molar mass, greater organo-mineral association, and resistance to mineralization, act as long-term reservoirs that determine the total N stocks.
The labile fractions, on the other hand, reflect pools of rapid turnover and response to recent inputs of organic matter and management. In the biplot graph (Figure 4), spatial segregation of the samples by land use is observed, with groupings associated with higher humic loadings (e.g., eucalyptus and Cerrado) and others more oriented towards the axis of labile fractions (e.g., agriculture), which corroborates the hypothesis that litter quality and structural management modulate the functional composition of the N pool.

Note: The circles represent the samples colored by environment, while the arrows indicate the contributions of the nitrogen fractions.
From a management and ecological perspective, the predominance of humic fractions in predicting TN indicates that practices aimed at increasing the stability of soil organic matter (reducing tillage, increasing lignified inputs, maintaining mulch cover) tend to promote N retention in more persistent forms, strengthening the storage capacity and resilience of the system. Conversely, systems with a higher proportion of labile fractions show greater immediate availability of N, but lower long-term retention capacity, implying the need for continuous management interventions to maintain fertility.

3.2. Prediction of total phosphorus
Similarly to what was observed for nitrogen, the TP content and its humic fractions (TPHum, TPHA, LabileP) showed a high structural correlation in the PLSR model (Figure 5). This behavior is aligned with the concept of co-accumulation and co-stabilization of nutrients in SOM, according to which P and N associate with organo-mineral complexes or are simultaneously adsorbed to organic and mineral colloids, favoring the persistence of total stocks (Gerke, 2022; Tivet et al., 2013).
The application of multivariate techniques such as PLSR in soil science studies has proven particularly suitable for dealing with datasets characterized by multicollinearity between variables, as demonstrated by Sekaran et al. (2020) in analyses of biochemical activities and structure of soil microbial communities.
The correlation between LabileP/PMOL and the humic fractions of P indicates synergy between nutrient availability and the fractionation of organic matter, reflecting dynamic processes of transformation and stabilization of P in the soil (Figure 5). These co-stabilization mechanisms involve the specific adsorption of orthophosphate (H₂PO₄⁻) on humic acid surfaces by hydrogen bonds and complexation with carboxylic and phenolic groups, the formation of ternary complexes between organic P, polyvalent cations (Ca²⁺, Fe³⁺, Al³⁺) and humic substances, which reduce the solubility and mobility of P in the profile, and the physical occlusion of labile P in microaggregates stabilized by humin and recalcitrant material, protecting it against rapid mineralization. These processes are particularly relevant in highly weathered Oxisols, whose mineralogy, dominated by kaolinite, gibbsite, and Fe and Al oxides, confers a high capacity for P fixation, with SOM being the main modulator of this fixation through competition for adsorption sites.

Note: Visual pattern similar to that of TN, reflecting the structural association between N and P in the soil.
The VIP scores of the P fractions showed a similar pattern to that of N, with TPHum and TPHA as the main predictors (Table 1). This structural parallelism reinforces the idea that progressive humification processes, in which labile compounds are gradually converted into intermediate humic fractions and, subsequently, into recalcitrant humin, act in a synchronized manner for both nutrients. The predominance of TPHum as a key variable indicates that, in tropical soils under established vegetation, organic P tends to remain immobilized in stable, long-lasting forms, unlike in agricultural systems, where frequent tillage accelerates mineralization and favors the accumulation of labile fractions.
The strong correlation between VIP(TPHum) and VIP(TNHum) (r > 0.85) confirms that edaphoclimatic factors such as temperature, humidity, microbial activity, and soil texture jointly control the fractionation of N and P, suggesting that management practices aimed at conserving humic fractions promote integrated benefits for both nutrients.

Variable	VIP	Relevance

These findings reinforce that the prediction of TN and TP in tropical soil systems should consider not only fractions directly associated with each element, but also the multinutrient nature of SOM and its co-regulation by biogeochemical pathways of decomposition, complexation, and physicochemical protection. The high predictive capacity of the PLSR model (variance explained > 80% with two latent components) demonstrates that chemical fractionation effectively captures the functional processes that govern nutrient availability, providing a solid basis for the development of soil quality indicators and monitoring of degradation or recovery trajectories in different land-use systems.
3.3 Structural relationships between labile, humic fractions and total stocks (PLS-SEM)
The structural model was configured as a two-level hierarchical component model (HCM), combining first-order constructs representing the functional fractions of N and P and second-order constructs synthesizing the total stocks (Figure 6). This approach follows the recommendations of Hair Jr et al. (2021) for modeling reflective structures with repeated indicators, ensuring that the shared variance between the functional dimensions is propagated to the higher-order constructs.
At the first level, labile N and labile P were measured by the pairs LabileN/NMOL and LabileP/PMOL, while humic N and humic P aggregated TNFA, TNHA, TNHum and TPFA, TPHA, PTHum, respectively. The measurement step revealed high factor loadings (β = 0.981 to 0.990) for all indicators, confirming that the manifest variables robustly capture the intrinsic variability of each functional fraction (Figure 6).

Note: The arrows indicate the causal influence paths, with their width proportional to the magnitude of the path coefficients.
The model reveals that the humic fractions of N and P exhibit greater predictive power of total stocks compared to the labile fractions, with path coefficients varying between study environments, demonstrating functional heterogeneity induced by management.
The high internal consistency (α > 0.97) and average variance extracted above 0.95 (Table 2) indicate excellent convergent reliability for all constructs, easily exceeding the recommended thresholds for studies with reflective structures (Hair Jr. et al., 2021). Inspection of the cross-loading matrix and the HTMT ratio confirmed the absence of discriminant validity problems, demonstrating that the labile and humic fractions retain conceptual specificities even when aggregated into second-order constructs. Thus, the measurement stage provides a robust basis for interpreting the structural results, minimizing the risk of biases associated with excessive collinearity between indicators.
In the structural stage, the global model presented a coefficient of determination of 0.959 for both TN and TP, explaining practically all the observed variability of the stocks under Cerrado conditions (Table 2). This level of fit is rare in edaphic studies and indicates that functional fractionation summarizes most of the processes that modulate the accumulation of N and P. The path coefficients derived from the humic fractions (β = 1.286 for humic N → TN and humic P → TP) were positive, high, and statistically different from zero in the bootstrap resamplings, showing that marginal increases in these compartments result in proportionally greater increases in total stocks. This behavior is consistent with field evidence that points to humic fractions as dominant nutrient reservoirs in Oxisols under silviculture and long-term pastures (Ferreira et al., 2021; Pegoraro et al., 2011).

The negative coefficients associated with labile fractions (ß = -0.313 for labile N → TN and labile P → TP) reflect the partitioning mechanism between rapidly renewing pools and stable reserves. As the system accumulates recalcitrant compounds, part of the labile forms is incorporated into the humic matrix, producing an inverse effect in the structural models. This result is supported by chronosequences that document the progressive transfer of labile N and P to humified fractions during the maturation of forest and agricultural systems, it is therefore not a matter of biogeochemical antagonism, but evidence that the model captured the dynamics of incremental humification of the system (Araújo Filho et al., 2025; Marinho Junior et al., 2021).
The symmetry of the coefficients between N and P reinforces the hypothesis of biogeochemical coupling of the two macronutrients, governed by common processes of humification, organo-mineral complexation, and structural protection of organic matter. This pattern corroborates observations in shaded coffee agroforestry systems in the Northeast, where the increase in total organic carbon (TOC) is simultaneously associated with increases in the humic fractions of N and P and the improvement of the soil's physical structure (Crespo et al., 2024).  The PLS-SEM results confirm that the joint stabilization of N and P is a key attribute of systems managed with a high input of lignified residues, a central element for understanding edaphic functionality in the land uses evaluated.
The structural equation modeling based on partial least squares (PLS-SEM) allowed quantifying the relative contributions of the labile and humic fractions of N and P to the total stocks of these nutrients. The most significant result was the achievement of R² = 0.959 for both total N and total P in the Cerrado environment, indicating that the model explains 95.9% of the observed variance. This coefficient of determination represents good performance in modeling complex soil systems, especially considering the inherent heterogeneity of tropical soil ecosystems, characterized by high spatial variability and multiple nutrient transformation mechanisms. The replication of this performance between N and P (R² = 0.959 for both) shows that the same functional compartments (humic and labile fractions) operate as structural determinants for both macronutrients, suggesting a close geochemical coupling between the dynamics of N and P in this soil matrix.
The dominant positive relationship of the humic fractions (ß = 1.286) corroborates the hypothesis that these fractions constitute the main long-term reservoir of these nutrients, representing approximately 56% more of the unit contribution to total stocks compared to the final thirds of the model. The magnitude of ß = 1.286 indicates that increments of one unit in the humic fraction generate an increase of 1.286 units in the total stock, establishing these fractions as dominant predictors of nutrient availability in the system. This dominance of the humic fractions is consistent with observations by Pegoraro et al. (2011), who demonstrated that humic substances (fulvic acids, humic acids, and humins) represent the main compartments of C and N in soils under different land uses, and with Ferreira et al. (2021), who showed that mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) constitutes the most stable reservoir of nutrients in Brazilian tropical soils.
Studies in shaded agroforestry systems confirm this pattern, demonstrating that the presence of native trees significantly modulates soil biogeochemical processes. Crespo et al. (2024) showed in shaded coffee systems that TOC acts as a central integrator between porosity, acidity, and nutrient availability, with areas with greater tree cover exhibiting TOC greater than 2.5% and microporosity of ~30%, reflecting colluvial accumulation and protection against accelerated mineralization.
Principal component analysis in these systems explained 60.2% of the total variation, with PC1 (physical structure and fertility, 38.5%) and PC2 (organic matter quality, 21.7%), corroborating the importance of humic fractions as structural determinants of soil functionality. These results reinforce that the integration between tree diversity and pedogenetic processes favors the stabilization of nutrients in the humic fractions, a process particularly relevant in highly weathered Oxisols where the low cation exchange capacity increases the dependence on organic matter for N and P retention.
The negative relationship of the labile fractions (ß = -0.313), although seemingly contradictory at first glance, reflects a fundamental biogeochemical mechanism in tropical soils: the structural collinearity represented in the model constitutes a mathematical transformation of the dynamic interaction between pools. Specifically, when the humic fraction increases, the labile fraction relatively decreases, as the model captures the phenomenon of progressive humification where labile compartments are continuously converted into recalcitrant humic fractions (Marinho Junior et al., 2021).
This dynamic does not indicate a negative causal relationship between the compartments, but rather describes the nature of nutrient partitioning; in soils with high microbial decomposition (such as the Cerrado), the conversion labile N → humic N → recalcitrant N occurs sequentially, resulting in compensation of signals in the multiple regression coefficients. The standard β(humic) = +1.286 and β(labile) = -0.313 maintains the expected proportionality, where total N = 1.286 × N humic - 0.313 × N labile shows a statistical adjustment that avoids excessive multicollinearity.

3.4 Results of the multi-group analysis by land use (PLS-MGA)

Table 3 demonstrates the multi-group analysis (PLS-MGA). For the Cerrado sensu stricto, it supports the greatest humic effect among the natural systems (ß = 1.286), configuring the biogeochemical reference of balanced humification in which accumulation and mineralization operate in a quasi-stationary dynamic. This level delineates the baseline used to interpret the deviations observed in the other environments. Conventional agriculture deviates from this reference by presenting ß(humic) = 1.180, 8.2% lower than the Cerrado.
The reduction indicates a reconfiguration of the partitioning between pools in which the lower humic contribution is accompanied by a less negative labile fraction (-0.237 against -0.313 in the Cerrado), signaling that mechanical tillage and the recurrent input of mineral fertilizers maintain a high proportion of rapidly available compounds. In tropical agricultural systems, such practices accelerate the transfer of N and P from stable reserves to soluble forms, making maintenance fertilization essential to avoid abrupt drops in stocks (St. Luce et al., 2022).
Silvicultural systems occupy an intermediate range (Table 3) where african mahogany (ß = 1.271) maintains a structure similar to the Cerrado, consistent with a less intensive management regime and moderate litter decomposition. Eucalyptus (ß = 1.275) slightly surpasses african mahogany, reflecting a significant accumulation of lignified residues that favor the incorporation of N and P into the humic fractions, a phenomenon already documented for mature plantations of the species [36, 37]. Teak, however, presents the maximum coefficient (ß = 1.372), indicating intensified humification. Although at first glance it seems indicative of greater stability, the high value occurs in conjunction with lower total stocks and high apparent density, suggesting that the recalcitrant teak litter slows down cycling and concentrates nutrients in less accessible compartments.
The progression Cerrado → african mahogany → eucalyptus → teak reinforces that litter quality is the main vector of differentiation between the systems. Litters with a high C:N ratio and high lignin content, such as those of T. grandis, tend to form resistant compounds that favor humic enrichment at the expense of labile fractions, reducing the rate of recycling and immediate availability (Araújo Filho et al., 2025).
In contrast, residues with greater lability (e.g., leguminous consortia) feed the labile pool and maintain the rapid renewal of nutrients, a condition that can be achieved by introducing green manure and diversifying tree species in the plots.
Table 3 – Path coefficients stratified by land use.
Land Use	Humic N → Total N	Labile N → Total N	Humic P → Total P	Labile P → Total P
Cerrado	1.286	-0.313	1.286	-0.313
Agriculture	1.180	-0.237	1.180	-0.237
African mahogany	1.271	-0.277	1.271	-0.277
Eucalyptus	1.275	-0.283	1.275	-0.283
Teak	1.372	-0.445	1.372	-0.445
Note: Standardized values indicate the magnitude of the structural relationships in each environment. Positive values indicate direct effects; negative values indicate inverse effects or collinearity adjustments.
For the range of variation of β(humic) from 1.180 (agriculture) to 1.372 (teak), this represents a relative amplitude of 16.2%, a significant magnitude considering that the model already explains 95.9% of the variance in optimal scenarios. This variation shows that management practices and species selection significantly influence the dynamics of humification, with direct implications for the sustainability of N and P stocks. The adoption of strategies that promote a balance between labile and humic fractions, such as crop rotation, no-till farming, and the incorporation of diversified organic matter, emerges as a central recommendation to optimize soil functionality in tropical systems.
3.5 Fuzzy integration of edaphic functionality: fuzzy soil sustainability index (FSNSI)
3.5.1 Fuzzy inference system and membership functions
The Fuzzy Soil Sustainability Index (FSNSI) was constructed from a Mamdani-type fuzzy inference system, integrating three input variables (TN, TP, and Ds) and one output variable (FSNSI, scale 0-10). The membership functions for the input variables can be observed in (Figure 7). The overlapping regions between classes allow for gradual transitions between linguistic states, a fundamental characteristic of fuzzy logic that distinguishes this approach from conventional discrete classifications. For TN and TP, normalized values below 3.3 were classified as "low," between 3.3 and 6.7 as "medium," and above 6.7 as "high." Ds was categorized as "low" (< 1.2 g/cm³), "medium" (1.2-1.4 g/cm³), and "high" (> 1.4 g/cm³).

Figure 8 presents the membership function of the output variable (FSNSI), structured into three categories of soil functionality: low (0-3.33, indicating severe degradation), medium (3.34-6.66, moderate functionality), and high (6.67-10.0, full sustainability). The system was configured with 16 inference rules (2³ = 8 base rules, duplicated to consider asymmetries in the input combinations), following the logical structure: “IF total N is X AND total P is Y AND density is Z, THEN FSNSI is W”. The rules were defined based on specialized pedological knowledge, prioritizing synergistic combinations between high chemical availability of nutrients and low compaction. The defuzzification method adopted was the centroid, which calculates the crisp output value as the center of gravity of the membership function resulting from the aggregation of the activated rules.

Figure 9 presents the membership function of the output variable (FSNSI), structured into three categories of edaphic functionality: low (0-3.33, indicating severe degradation), medium (3.34-6.66, moderate functionality), and high (6.67-10.0, full sustainability). The system was configured with 16 inference rules (2³ = 8 base rules, duplicated to consider asymmetries in the input combinations), following the logical structure: “IF total N is X AND total P is Y AND density is Z, THEN FSNSI is W”. The rules were defined based on specialized pedological knowledge, prioritizing synergistic combinations between high chemical nutrient availability and low compaction. The defuzzification method adopted was the centroid method, which calculates the crisp output value as the center of gravity of the membership function resulting from the aggregation of the activated rules.

Note: Boxplots with distinct visual patterns for each system. Different letters indicate significant differences according to the Tukey HSD test (p < 0.05). Points represent individual values.
The performance of eucalyptus (FSNSI = 6.07) differs significantly from the Cerrado sensu stricto (FSNSI = 4.42), with a statistically significant difference (Δ = 1.64, 95% CI: 0.07-3.22, p = 0.036). This result contradicts the initial expectation that the native vegetation would represent the state of maximum functionality.
This behavior may be related to the combination of the high input of lignin and phenolic compound-rich litter from eucalyptus, favoring the formation of stable humic fractions of N and P; and a deep root system that promotes soil bioturbation, locally reducing bulk density in the surface layers (St. Luce et al., 2022).
Another related factor is the absence of biomass removal by harvesting in the evaluated system (unmanaged stand for 11 years), allowing for continuous accumulation of organic matter. Silva et al. (2024) documented that the conversion of native Cerrado areas to agricultural systems profoundly alters the dynamics of CO2 emission and soil carbon stocks, while Tang et al. (2023) demonstrated that acacia and eucalyptus plantations modify the molecular composition of particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) fractions in subtropical native pasture soils, suggesting that the quality of plant residues plays a determining role in nutrient stabilization.
Furthermore, the native Cerrado presented an average FSNSI of 4.42, classified as "medium" functionality, with a bimodal distribution: 50% of the samples in the "low" class and 40% in the "high" class (Table 4). This heterogeneity reflects the natural vertical stratification of Cerrado soils, where the surface layers (0-20 cm) concentrate most of the organic matter and have reduced density (average of 0.97 g cm-³), while the subsurface layers (30-50 cm) show chemical impoverishment and natural compaction. The range of FSNSI values in the Cerrado (1.56 to 8.57, range = 7.01) was the highest among all systems, evidencing pronounced vertical gradients.
The conventional agriculture data recorded an average FSNSI value of 4.25, with a balanced distribution between the "low" and "medium" classes (37.5% each), indicating compromised, but not collapsed, edaphic functionality. The moderate coefficient of variation (60.6%) indicates a tendency towards vertical homogenization of the soil profile, a consequence of recurrent mechanized preparation (plowing and harrowing), which promotes mixing of the layers and reduces natural gradients, a phenomenon widely researched (Leal et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Sadiq et al., 2021 )Even so, it is observed that 22.5% of the samples reached a "high" classification, possibly related to recently fertilized surface layers or microsites with residual accumulation of organic matter, a context in which localized management and organic input elevate the functional indicators of the soil.
Finally, african mahogany showed intermediate performance (FSNSI = 4.54), with a relatively balanced distribution among the three classes (40% low, 30% medium, 30% high). This pattern suggests a transition between a state of degradation and functional recovery, reflecting less intensive management compared to agriculture. The system did not differ statistically from the Cerrado (p = 0.999) or from Agriculture (p = 0.986), positioning itself as an "ecological transition" system, with the potential for improved functionality through adjustments in management (maintenance of mulch cover, reduction of mechanized interventions).

3.5.2 Vertical stratification of the FSNSI
The depth-stratified analysis revealed vertical gradients in the FSNSI, with distinct patterns among different land uses (Figure 10). A significant decrease in soil functionality was observed with increasing depth, reflecting the combined reduction in N and P stocks and the increase in soil density in the subsurface layers. The 0-10 cm and 10-20 cm layers systematically presented the highest FSNSI values, concentrating 78% of the samples classified with high functionality.
In the native Cerrado, this stratification showed an average FSNSI decreasing from 7.04 ± 0.05 in the 0-10 cm layer (high functionality) to 1.59 ± 0.03 in the 40-50 cm layer (low functionality). This vertical gradient, representing a 445% variation, reflects the natural biogeochemical architecture of Oxisols under Cerrado. In these soils, the superficial root system promotes intense nutrient cycling in the upper layers, while the deeper layers are characterized by high weathering, historical leaching of nutrients, and natural cohesive compaction (Sainju et al., 2022).
Figure 10 – Distribution of the FSNSI stratified by depth and land use.
 
Note: Distinct visual patterns identify each system. A systematic decrease in soil functionality is observed with increasing depth in all evaluated systems.
Eucalyptus maintained high FSNSI values up to a depth of 20 cm (average of 8.15 at 0-10 cm and 8.18 at 10-20 cm), but showed an abrupt decline from 20 cm onwards (3.97 at 20-30 cm), suggesting a superficial concentration of the benefits of litter input. Agriculture exhibited a similar pattern, with high values in the surface layers due to fertilization (8.05 at 0-10 cm), but a functional collapse from 30 cm onwards (1.68 at 30-40 cm), indicating that the benefits of chemical management do not reach the subsurface layers.
Teak presented the most vertically homogeneous pattern, with little variation between depths (range = 1.79 to 3.35), suggesting that functional degradation is generalized throughout the entire profile. This result reinforces the need for specific management interventions for this species, including maintenance fertilization, incorporation of organic matter, and mechanical or biological decompaction practices.
3.5.3 Correlations between input variables and FSNSI
Pearson correlation analysis (Table 4) confirmed that TN and TP were the predictors most strongly associated with FSNSI (r = 0.789, p < 0.001 for both), explaining approximately 62% of the index variance (r² = 0.622). This result validates the logical structure of the fuzzy system, demonstrating that the chemical availability of nutrients constitutes the primary factor in determining soil functionality. The labile and humic fractions of N and P also showed significant positive correlations (r = 0.616-0.627, p < 0.001), reinforcing the functional interdependence between chemical compartments.

Soil density showed a moderate negative correlation with the FSNSI (r = -0.424, p < 0.001), reinforcing the role of compaction as a transversal limiting factor of soil functionality. Compacted layers reduce macroporosity, restrict oxygen diffusion, and shift N cycling to partially anaerobic pathways that increase N2O emission and reduce net mineralization (Severiano et al., 2011; Frene et al., 2024). Structural sealing also decreases hydraulic conductivity and directs newly applied phosphorus to the surface, while humic fractions migrate to the less accessible subsoil, compromising nutrient use efficiency (Pulido-Moncada et al., 2022; Naganna et al., 2017).
These physical restrictions explain the penalty introduced by the FSNSI. Profiles with a density close to 1.6 g cm⁻³, as observed in teak and agriculture, receive a reduction of approximately 40% in the index even when total N and P contents are adequate. The combination of compaction, limited oxygenation, and vertical redistribution of nutrient reservoirs, therefore, supports the contrast between land uses and outlines the need for management interventions that combine organic input and decompaction (Martin et al., 2024).
Soil texture also influenced the FSNSI, with sand correlating negatively (r = -0.439, p < 0.001) and clay positively (r = 0.267, p = 0.001), reflecting the greater capacity for nutrient and water retention in clay soils. This pattern is consistent with the physicochemical protection theory of SOM, according to which fine soil fractions (clay < 2 µm, silt 2-50 µm) form stable organo-mineral complexes that protect N and P against rapid mineralization. In sandy soils, the low specific surface area (< 5 m² g⁻¹) and the absence of reactive minerals (predominance of inert quartz) limit the adsorption of humic substances and the formation of microaggregates, resulting in less stable SOM and greater susceptibility to mineralization.
The positive correlation between clay and FSNSI (r = 0.267) demonstrates that, even in highly weathered Oxisols where the mineralogy is dominated by low-activity kaolinite, the increase in clay content still confers measurable functional benefits, probably mediated by greater water retention and increased surface area available for nutrient adsorption and microbial colonization.
These results reinforce the suitability of the fuzzy approach for integrating multiple dimensions of soil functionality, simultaneously capturing chemical (nutrient availability), physical (compaction), and mineralogical (texture) aspects. Fuzzy logic allowed translating these quantitative relationships into an interpretable index, facilitating the identification of priority systems for conservation management interventions and soil quality recovery.
The validation of these relationships through multivariate correlation analysis demonstrates that the FSNSI is not merely an empirical synthesis, but reflects fundamental biogeochemical processes that govern soil functionality in tropical environments. The magnitude of the correlations (r = 0.62-0.79 for chemical variables, r = -0.42 for density) is within the expected range for complex pedological systems where multiple factors interact non-linearly, validating the robustness of the fuzzy system as an integrative diagnostic tool. The combination of PLSR, PLS-SEM, and fuzzy inference synthesized the dynamics of N and P at multiple scales, aligning with methodological recommendations for complex systems (Hair Jr. et al., 2021). The PLSR step highlighted humic fractions as the main predictors of total stocks, while PLS-SEM quantified the dominance of the TNHA, TNHum, TPHA, and TPHum compartments (ß = 1.286 for humic N → TN), consistent with evidence that humic substances constitute the main stable reservoirs in managed Oxisols (Ferreira et al., 2021; Pegoraro et al., 2011). In contrast, negative coefficients assigned to labile fractions reflect the continuous transfer of these pools to more recalcitrant forms, a dynamic also reported in tropical chronosequences (Marinho Junior et al., 2021).
The FSNSI revealed clear functional differences between land uses, with eucalyptus showing a higher index than Cerrado (6.07 versus 4.42), consistent with this species ability to enrich humic fractions and improve physical structure when residues are not removed (Crespo et al., 2024). Teak exhibited the lowest performance (2.77), reinforcing that highly recalcitrant litter and residual compaction limit nutrient recycling and increase the physical penalty of the index (Longepierre et al., 2022). Agricultural systems maintained intermediate values (4.25), indicating that mineral fertilization sustains surface availability but does not reverse the degradation of subsurface layers.
The correlations confirmed that TN and TP explain a substantial part of the FSNSI variation (r = 0.789), but soil density was negatively correlated with the index (r = -0.424), highlighting that physical degradation remains a transversal limiting factor even in chemically enriched soils (Silva et al., 2024). Thus, the integrated interpretation of the three approaches shows that isolated indicators can mask imbalances, while the FSNSI aggregates chemical and physical dimensions consistent with the structural architecture revealed by PLS-SEM, offering a robust tool for prioritizing management and restoration actions.

4. Conclusion

The methodological integration (PLSR, PLS-SEM, and fuzzy inference) allowed for the structural and functional characterization of N and P dynamics in tropical soils, revealing the heterogeneity induced by management;
Humic fractions act as key predictors of nutrient availability, functioning as integrators of multiple biogeochemical processes and suggesting a fundamental geochemical coupling in Oxisols;
The functional response of the soil is transversely limited by physical factors, such as density, establishing that physical degradation is not compensated by high chemical performance;
The divergence in performance between systems (eucalyptus outperforming native Cerrado) questions conservationist paradigms, indicating that functionality is determined by the dynamic interaction between organic matter input, management practices, and pedological legacy;
High biochemical functionality does not guarantee sustainability in intensive exploitation regimes, as evidenced by the functional reduction in systems with teak;
The FSNSI proved to be a multiscale diagnostic tool, but requires local pedoclimatic adaptation and integration with biological indicators for a complete sustainability diagnosis.
