**Response to Reviewers**

Dear Editor Bing Chen and Reviewers,

We thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We carefully considered all comments and suggestions provided by Reviewer 1, and we acknowledge that the previous version was excessively long, contained redundancies, and did not present the statistical framework with the necessary rigor for heterogeneous soil datasets.

In the revised version, the manuscript was substantially reorganized to emphasize mechanistic soil biogeochemical interpretation while preserving reproducible computational structure. The statistical framework was strengthened by adopting Generalized Linear Models using a Gamma distribution with bootstrap resampling (n = 1000), which is coherent with non normal and heteroscedastic soil responses and supports robust inference via Wald statistics, Exp(B), and 95% confidence intervals. The fuzzy methodology was formalized in a dedicated subsection that details membership functions, the inference rule base, and defuzzification equations, clarifying the mathematical mapping from soil state variables to the FSNSI. Concomitantly, the Results and Discussion were condensed to remove redundant and speculative statements, and every analysis referenced in the Results is now explicitly described in the Methods.

### Reviewer 1

Regarding Comment 1, we agree with the concern and revised the manuscript to prioritize soil biogeochemical processes rather than presenting the work as a purely informatics exercise. The revised narrative connects modeling outputs from PLS SEM and fuzzy inference to mechanisms such as the turnover between labile pools and humic reservoirs and to physical constraints associated with soil structure.

Regarding Comment 2, the title was revised to better reflect both the N and P dynamics across land uses and the proposed decision support indicator. The current title is presented in the revised manuscript.

Regarding Comment 3, the Abstract was edited to reduce undefined acronyms and to highlight the central results.

Regarding Comment 4, the Introduction was streamlined by reducing general background and sharpening the motivation around N P coupling and its co stabilization in tropical, highly weathered soils. The choice of land uses was clarified as representative of regional land occupation dynamics in the Cerrado biome.

Regarding Comment 5, the detailed description of the study areas was replaced by Table 1, which synthesizes stand age, planting procedure and density, soil preparation, and fertilization. Importantly, the fertilization regimes are now contextualized and justified using technical references associated with each production system, because fertilization is a first order driver of N and P availability and partitioning.

Regarding Comment 6, Figure 3, which presented the soil profile and sampling illustration, was removed as requested. Figure 2 was retained because it provides essential information for site characterization and reproducibility, particularly the visual identification of the land use situations that ground the causal comparisons developed in the statistical and fuzzy frameworks. To avoid redundancy, the figure content was restricted to study area depiction and does not duplicate analytical results.

Regarding Comment 7, the text was clarified to state that labile N and P refer to operationally defined fractions determined by the Hedley procedure for P and by the Shang and Tiessen procedure for N, and that these fractions are distinct from humic fractionation and from the light organic matter pool.

Regarding Comment 8, the Statistical Analysis subsection was substantially condensed, and the methodological choice was made explicit by prioritizing GLM with Gamma distribution to better accommodate the empirical distributional properties of the dataset.

Regarding Comment 9, the Results and Discussion were fully rewritten and reorganized into a concise structure that first addresses the dynamics of N and P fractions, then interprets structural mechanisms via PLS SEM paths, and finally integrates the evidence into the fuzzy index FSNSI. Redundant interpretation and unsupported speculation were removed.

Regarding Comment 10, the captions were revised to define the estimated variables and to ensure that figure legends are in English.

Regarding Comment 11, the text now clarifies model fit reporting and discusses where Cerrado specific behavior was highlighted, in alignment with the multi group analysis framing.

Regarding Comment 12, the Methods now explicitly describe the GLM approach used to compare FSNSI between land uses, including the post hoc strategy and distributional assumptions.

We believe these changes result in a stronger, more rigorous, and clearer manuscript, and we hope the revised version meets the standards for publication.

Sincerely,

The Authors
