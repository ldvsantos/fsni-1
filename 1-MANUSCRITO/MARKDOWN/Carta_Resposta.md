**Response to Reviewers**

Dear Editor Bing Chen and Reviewers,

We would like to thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript. We have carefully considered all comments and suggestions provided by Reviewer 1. We acknowledge that the previous version was excessively long, contained redundancies, and lacked statistical rigor in some areas.

In this revised version, we have performed a major overhaul of the manuscript to address these issues. Specifically, we have:
1.  **Enhanced Statistical Rigor**: We replaced standard ANOVA with **Multivariate Generalized Linear Models (GLM)** using a Gamma distribution and bootstrap resampling (n=1000). This approach correctly handles the non-normality and heteroscedasticity of the soil data, providing more robust estimates (Wald statistics, Exp(B), 95% CI).
2.  **Clarified the Fuzzy Methodology**: We added a dedicated subsection (2.5) detailing the mathematical structure of the Fuzzy Soil Nutritional Sustainability Index (FSNSI), including membership functions, inference rules, and defuzzification equations, to demonstrate its robustness as a diagnostic tool.
3.  **Condensed and Focused the Text**: We significantly reduced the "Results and Discussion" section, removing speculative text and focusing on the agronomic interpretation of the statistical models.
4.  **Ensured Methodological Consistency**: We verified that every statistical test mentioned in the Results (including Pearson correlation, PCA, HCA, PLS-SEM) is explicitly described in the Methods section.

Below is a point-by-point response to the reviewer's comments.

### **Reviewer 1**

**Comment 1:** The MS shows many inconsistencies and neglect aspects. It seems to be more an informatic study instead of an environmental research. Particularly, because it includes too much data handling, but the raw data are absent. Moreover, the MS wording is redundant, in consequence is difficult to read and understand.
**Response:** We agree. We have rewritten the manuscript to focus on **soil biogeochemical processes** rather than just the modeling aspect.
*   **Action:** We removed redundant wording and condensed the text. We explicitly connected the modeling results (PLS-SEM, Fuzzy) to agronomic mechanisms (e.g., labile-to-humic turnover, physical protection).
*   **Action:** To address the "informatic study" concern, we provided the mathematical formulation of the Fuzzy Index in the Methods (Section 2.5) to show it is based on solid soil attributes (N, P, Density), not just data manipulation.

**Comment 2:** The MS title is confusing and does not reflex the MS objective... what about the P and N dynamic in the different land use of the tropical soils?
**Response:** The title has been changed to: **"Fuzzy Soil Nutritional Sustainability Index (FSNSI) for Assessing Production-Phase Impacts in Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment"**. This reflects the dual focus on N/P dynamics and the sustainability assessment tool.

**Comment 3:** Abstract: please don’t use acronyms (so many) without definition.
**Response:** We have revised the Abstract to remove undefined acronyms and focus on the main findings.

**Comment 4:** Introduction: Lines 72-99 (soil processes well known), Lines 100-124 (models too general), Lines 135-138 (land uses not justified).
**Response:** The Introduction has been streamlined. We summarized well-known soil processes and focused on the specific gap regarding the N-P coupling in tropical soils. We justified the choice of land uses (Eucalyptus, Mahogany, Teak, Agriculture) as representative of the regional land occupation dynamics in the Cerrado biome.

**Comment 5:** Methods: Lines 170 (subtitle ambiguous), Lines 185-221 (text difficult to read). Please, change by a table.
**Response:** We have replaced the detailed textual description of the study areas with **Table 1**, which summarizes stand age, spacing, soil preparation, and fertilization for all land uses. This significantly reduced the length and improved clarity.

**Comment 6:** Fig 2 is not necessary: eliminate. Figure 3: again, it is not necessary: eliminate.
**Response:** **Figure 2** (map/photos) and **Figure 3** (soil profile/sampling) have been removed from the manuscript as requested.

**Comment 7:** Lines 278-283: ...labile P and N must be quantified from soil samples before humic acids fractioning. Or, does the labile fraction refer to the LOM?
**Response:** We clarified in the text that "Labile N/P" refers to the specific fractions determined by the Hedley (P) and Shang & Tiessen (N) methods, distinct from the humic fractionation.

**Comment 8:** The statistical analysis subsection is too long (4.5 pages), and repetitive: please, summarize.
**Response:** We have drastically summarized the Statistical Analysis section (now Section 2.6).
*   **Action:** We condensed the description of multivariate tests.
*   **Action:** We upgraded the methodology from ANOVA to **GLM with Gamma distribution** to better fit the data properties, as described in the revised text.

**Comment 9:** Results and discussion: This section is hard to read... unnecessarily long (26 pages), summarize.
**Response:** This was the main focus of our revision. We have **completely rewritten the Results and Discussion section**. It is now organized into three concise subsections:
1.  **Dynamics of N and P Fractions**: Focusing on the role of humic fractions.
2.  **Structural Mechanisms**: Focusing on the causal paths (PLS-SEM).
3.  **Fuzzy Integration**: Focusing on the sustainability index (FSNSI).
We removed repetitive arguments and speculative interpretations not supported by data.

**Comment 10:** Figs 4 and 5: the “est” variables need explanation. Moreover, the legend (Ambiente) must be translated to English.
**Response:** We have updated the figure captions to explain abbreviations and ensured all legends are in English in the final manuscript version.

**Comment 11:** Table 2: why is the R2 shown only for Cerrado?
**Response:** In the revised text, we discuss the model fit for the global model and highlight specific differences where relevant in the Multi-Group Analysis (PLS-MGA) section.

**Comment 12:** Lines 656-658: the FSNSI statistical comparison (ANOVA?) has not been mentioned in the methods.
**Response:** We have corrected this inconsistency.
*   **Action:** The Methods section (2.6) now explicitly describes the **GLM approach** used to compare the FSNSI between land uses, including the specific post-hoc tests (Bonferroni) and distribution assumptions.

We believe these changes have resulted in a much stronger, scientifically rigorous, and focused manuscript. We hope it now meets the standards for publication.

Sincerely,

The Authors.
