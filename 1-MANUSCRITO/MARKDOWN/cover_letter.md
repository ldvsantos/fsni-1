Environmental Monitoring and Assessment

Dear Editor,

On behalf of my co-authors, I submit the manuscript "Soil nutritional sustainability in Cerrado Oxisols using a fuzzy index (FSNSI)" for consideration in Environmental Monitoring and Assessment. The study is grounded in a tropical savanna region and focuses on highly weathered tropical soils, in which nutrient limitation and strong organomineral stabilization impose constraints on productivity and ecosystem function. This study develops and validates the Fuzzy Soil Nutritional Sustainability Index, an indicator designed for monitoring and assessment that integrates nitrogen and phosphorus stocks with soil physical integrity, expressed as bulk density, to quantify edaphic functionality under land-use change.

Field data from native Cerrado, agricultural land use, and Eucalyptus plantations show that FSNSI discriminates land uses under a Gamma GLM framework with bootstrap resampling. The proposed workflow couples multivariate causal modeling with fuzzy inference to translate coupled N and P dynamics and soil physical constraints into an operational output that supports prioritization and, when combined with GIS layers, hotspot screening.

We confirm that this manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors have approved the final version and agree with its submission. The authors declare no conflicts of interest. The underlying dataset used in the analyses is available at artigo_5/fsni/6-ESTATISTICA/dados.csv. No experiments involving humans or animals were conducted.

Sincerely,
