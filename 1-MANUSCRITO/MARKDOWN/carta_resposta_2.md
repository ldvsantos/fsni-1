Response to reviewer comments received in the current revision round

Dear Editor and Reviewer

We thank you for the careful evaluation and constructive suggestions. Below we report the actions implemented in the revised manuscript up to this stage, following each point raised in your latest comments.

Regarding the request that all figures should be presented in English, we revised figure captions and manuscript references to ensure full English wording in the text. In addition, the figures identified as containing non English embedded labels were flagged for final graphical re export before submission of the next package.

Regarding the request in the Introduction for a citation supporting the premise cited around lines 65 to 67 in the Word file, we inserted an additional reference that explicitly supports the statement on stabilization and dynamics of soil organic matter in managed systems. The text now cites Carvalho et al. 2023 in the introductory rationale.

Regarding the recommendation to replace Stevenson 1994 with a more recent source around line 75 in the Word file, we replaced Stevenson with Carvalho et al. 2023 in the Introduction and in the Results and Discussion where the same conceptual support had been used. The bibliography was updated accordingly and Stevenson 1994 was removed from the active citation set.

Regarding the question about who exactly is represented by recent scientific interest around lines 76 to 75 in the Word file, we rewrote the sentence to explicitly identify that this interest is represented by recent studies on tropical and highly weathered soils, with direct supporting citations to Cao et al. 2021, Gerke 2022, and Marinho Junior et al. 2021.

Regarding the observation that the hypothesis was not clearly presented in the Introduction, we rewrote the hypothesis paragraph to make the causal chain explicit. The revised text now states that nutrient stabilization is controlled by the balance between humic retention and labile turnover, with bulk density acting as a mediator of biogeochemical fluxes, and that managed systems are expected to shift allocation toward labile and residual compartments relative to native vegetation.

Regarding the Methods comment about low fertility around line 131 in the Word file, we specified that the reference is to low natural chemical fertility in the studied Oxisols, associated with low available phosphorus and high aluminum influence.

Regarding the Methods comment on English description in the figure around line 133 in the Word file, the in text labels and captions were maintained in English in the revised manuscript and the remaining non English labels embedded in graphic files were identified for replacement in the final figure export set.

Regarding the Methods comment on the number of replicates around line 151 in the Word file, we clarified that five trenches were opened per land use situation, corresponding to five replicates per treatment and twenty five trenches in total.

Regarding the Results and Discussion comment stating insufficient discussion of the variables, we expanded the mechanistic interpretation by linking observed stock patterns to input quality, organomineral protection, bulk density constraints, and the distinct roles of total pools and labile pools in FSNSI behavior. This revision was introduced in the sections discussing nutrient fractions and the FSNSI correlation structure.

As an additional consistency action, the citation integrity was rechecked after all edits and no unresolved citation keys remained.

We appreciate the comments and believe these revisions improved clarity, mechanistic depth, and reproducibility of the manuscript.

Regarding Reviewer 2 general comment on validating the use of humification theory, we revised the Introduction to explicitly acknowledge recent conceptual advances that move beyond classical humification and emphasize SOM persistence as a function of mineral association and spatial protection. We also clarified that humic fractionation is treated in this study as an operational analytical partition, and that interpretation is validated through convergence among fraction partitioning, PLSR structure, and PLS-SEM pathways.

Regarding Reviewer 2 concern on sampling and replication, we expanded the sampling description to state the full replication structure, with five trenches per land-use class and depth-stratified observations, and clarified how this structure supports inferential analysis across land use and depth.

Regarding the request to clarify the meaning of citations in the modeling interpretation section, we strengthened the explanatory text to explicitly connect each citation to the mechanism being discussed, especially in statements on structural constraints, nutrient retention, and land-use effects.

Regarding the request for additional PLSR details, we added methodological information on centering and scaling of predictors, leave-one-out cross-validation, number of latent components retained, and variable structure used in each model.

Regarding the request to specify the origin of data used in modeling, we added Appendix 3 with a dedicated summary of dataset architecture and model inputs, including number of observations, land-use classes, replicates, depth intervals, dependent variables, and independent variables used for nitrogen and phosphorus models.

Regarding the statement on labile fraction contribution, we clarified that the reported median of 12.18% refers to contribution to total nitrogen.

Regarding the request to define dependent and independent variables and provide variance information for Figures 3 and 4, we added explicit definitions of DVs and IVs in the Results text and in the figure captions, and reported explained variance information in Appendix 3.

Regarding the suggestion to better explain the analytical gain of FSNSI, we created a new subsection in Results and Discussion that explicitly describes how FSNSI advances interpretation of N and P functional dynamics by integrating persistent pools, labile pools, and physical impedance into a single decision-support metric.

Regarding Figure 2, the current manuscript already presents the five views as a composite with panel labels a to e. We retained this structure and reviewed caption wording for consistency.

Regarding Figures 3 and 4, we standardized abbreviation use in captions and added full variable definitions in text and caption context. The residual inconsistency visible inside plotted labels in exported images was identified and will be corrected in the next graphical re-export.

Regarding Figure 5 readability, we recognize that this request depends on direct editing of the source graphic and re-export at larger font scale. This action is pending external figure editing and was flagged as a required pre-submission step.

As an additional consistency action after these revisions, citation integrity was rechecked and no unresolved keys were detected.

Sincerely

The Authors
